# Pokemon Tier List

This website is (eventually) used for aggregating the public opinion on which Pokemon are best. (It's Aron.)

This is done by comparing two random pokemon to oneanother and asking a user to pick the better one. The better one has it's score increased by one and the worse one decreased by one. Pokemon with the lowest amount of votes get prioritized.
